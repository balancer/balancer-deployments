# 2023-05-25 - VeBoost V2

Deployment of the VeBoostV2 in L2 networks.
This contract shall be used as the delegation for the `VotingEscrowDelegationProxy`, using LayerZero's `OmniVotingEscrowChild` as Voting Escrow.

This allows using and delegating bridged veBAL balances in L2 networks.
The artifact is the same as in the [20221205-veboost-v2 task](../20221205-veboost-v2/); constructor arguments and fork tests differ.
