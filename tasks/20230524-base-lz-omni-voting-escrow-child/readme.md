# 2023-05-24 - LayerZero OmniVotingEscrowChild (base)

Deployment of the `OmniVotingEscrowChild` for Base.
Same as [`OmniVotingEscrowChild`](../20230524-lz-omni-voting-escrow-child/); the deployed artifact was compiled with a [different license](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/lz_gauges/commit/c6092aa851121bf499880a7df07d8b917f19840e) for Base, which results in a slightly different build-info artifact.
