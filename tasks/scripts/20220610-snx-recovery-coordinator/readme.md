# 2022-06-10 - SNX Recovery Coordinator

Deployment of the SNX Recovery Coordinator, which is used to return the sBTC and SNX which were swept into the ProtocolFeeCollector by the [DoubleEntrypointFixRelayer](../../20220513-double-entrypoint-fix-relayer/readme.md) as after Synthetix's [Saiph Release](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-saiph-release/) these tokens are no longer affected by the double-entrypoint issue.

See [the forum post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/tribe-dao-unclaimable-bal-rewards/3196) for more information.
