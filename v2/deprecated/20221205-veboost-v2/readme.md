# 2022-12-05 - veBoost V2

> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED: do not use** ⚠️
>
> This deployment was deprecated in favor of a new 2.1 version that is semantically equivalent, but allows migrating from this contract, and grants infinite approval to designated operators for the Stake DAO and Tetu BAL lockers: [veboost-v2.1](../../tasks/20250613-veboost-v2.1/)

Deployment of the veBoostV2, a replacement for the [`PreseededVotingEscrowDelegation`](../../tasks/20220530-preseeded-voting-escrow-delegation). This simplifies the boost contract greatly and allows integration with [Paladin's](https://paladin.vote/) boost market.
