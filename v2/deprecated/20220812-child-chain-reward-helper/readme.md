# 2022-08-12 - Child Chain Gauge Reward Helper

> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED: do not use** ⚠️
>
> Child chain gauge factory V1 was deprecated in favor of [child chain gauge factory V2](../../tasks/20230316-child-chain-gauge-factory-v2/), which handles both BAL and non-BAL rewards. V2 gauges do not require auxiliary contracts to manage rewards efficiently.

Deployment of the `ChildChainGaugeRewardHelper`, a helper contract that can be used to both query and claim child chain gauge tokens instantly, without waiting for the standard one-hour period.
