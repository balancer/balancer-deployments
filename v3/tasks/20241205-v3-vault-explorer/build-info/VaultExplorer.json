This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers\n// many common types of tokens that will not work with the Vault architecture. (See https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20\n// for examples of token features that are problematic for many protocols.)\n//\n// * Rebasing tokens (e.g., aDAI). The Vault keeps track of token balances in its internal accounting; any token whose\n//   balance changes asynchronously (i.e., outside a swap or liquidity operation), would get out-of-sync with this\n//   internal accounting. This category would also include \"airdrop\" tokens, whose balances can change unexpectedly.\n//\n// * Double entrypoint (e.g., old Synthetix tokens, now fixed). These could likewise bypass internal accounting by\n//   registering the token under one address, then accessing it through another. This is especially troublesome\n//   in v3, with the introduction of ERC4626 buffers.\n//\n// * Fee on transfer (e.g., PAXG). The Vault issues credits and debits according to given and calculated token amounts,\n//   and settlement assumes that the send/receive transfer functions transfer exactly the given number of tokens.\n//   If this is not the case, transactions will not settle. Unlike with the other types, which are fundamentally\n//   incompatible, it would be possible to design a Router to handle this - but we didn't try it. In any case, it's\n//   not supported in the current Routers.\n//\n// * Tokens with more than 18 decimals (e.g., YAM-V2). The Vault handles token scaling: i.e., handling I/O for\n//   amounts in native token decimals, but doing calculations with full 18-decimal precision. This requires reading\n//   and storing the decimals for each token. Since virtually all tokens are 18 or fewer decimals, and we have limited\n//   storage space, 18 was a reasonable maximum. Unlike the other types, this is enforceable by the Vault. Attempting\n//   to register such tokens will revert with `InvalidTokenDecimals`. Of course, we must also be able to read the token\n//   decimals, so the Vault only supports tokens that implement `IERC20Metadata.decimals`, and return a value less than\n//   or equal to 18.\n//\n//  * Token decimals are checked and stored only once, on registration. Valid tokens store their decimals as immutable\n//    variables or constants. Malicious tokens that don't respect this basic property would not work anywhere in DeFi.\n//\n// These types of tokens are supported but discouraged, as they don't tend to play well with AMMs generally.\n//\n// * Very low-decimal tokens (e.g., GUSD). The Vault has been extensively tested with 6-decimal tokens (e.g., USDC),\n//   but going much below that may lead to unanticipated effects due to precision loss, especially with smaller trade\n//   values.\n//\n// * Revert on zero value approval/transfer. The Vault has been tested against these, but peripheral contracts, such\n//   as hooks, might not have been designed with this in mind.\n//\n// * Other types from \"weird-erc20,\" such as upgradeable, pausable, or tokens with blocklists. We have seen cases\n//   where a token upgrade fails, \"bricking\" the token - and many operations on pools containing that token. Any\n//   sort of \"permissioned\" token that can make transfers fail can cause operations on pools containing them to\n//   revert. Even Recovery Mode cannot help then, as it does a proportional withdrawal of all tokens. If one of\n//   them is bricked, the whole operation will revert. Since v3 does not have \"internal balances\" like v2, there\n//   is no recourse.\n//\n//   Of course, many tokens in common use have some of these \"features\" (especially centralized stable coins), so\n//   we have to support them anyway. Working with common centralized tokens is a risk common to all of DeFi.\n\n/**\n * @notice Token types supported by the Vault.\n * @dev In general, pools may contain any combination of these tokens.\n *\n * STANDARD tokens (e.g., BAL, WETH) have no rate provider.\n * WITH_RATE tokens (e.g., wstETH) require a rate provider. These may be tokens like wstETH, which need to be wrapped\n * because the underlying stETH token is rebasing, and such tokens are unsupported by the Vault. They may also be\n * tokens like sEUR, which track an underlying asset, but are not yield-bearing. Finally, this encompasses\n * yield-bearing ERC4626 tokens, which can be used to facilitate swaps without requiring wrapping or unwrapping\n * in most cases. The `paysYieldFees` flag can be used to indicate whether a token is yield-bearing (e.g., waDAI),\n * not yield-bearing (e.g., sEUR), or yield-bearing but exempt from fees (e.g., in certain nested pools, where\n * yield fees are charged elsewhere).\n *\n * NB: STANDARD must always be the first enum element, so that newly initialized data structures default to Standard.\n */\nenum TokenType {\n    STANDARD,\n    WITH_RATE\n}\n\n/**\n * @notice Encapsulate the data required for the Vault to support a token of the given type.\n * @dev For STANDARD tokens, the rate provider address must be 0, and paysYieldFees must be false.
