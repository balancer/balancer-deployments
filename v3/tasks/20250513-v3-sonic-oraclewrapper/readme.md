# 2025-05-13 - QuantAMM

Deployment of the `QuantAMM` Oracle Wrappers for use in the update weight runner. Has to be done as a separate task given that pool creation requires approval of oracles in the update weight runner. deployment repo infrastructure also means that naming of the oracles in the output files has to be changed given duplicate keys in different tasks.
