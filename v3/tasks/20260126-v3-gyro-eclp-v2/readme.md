# 2026-01-26 - Gyro E-CLP V2

Second deployment of the `GyroECLPFactory` for Balancer V3.
Pools from this factory use Gyroscope's E-CLP math, suitable for fungible concentrated liquidity applications.

This version allows pools to be deployed with pool creators, and greatly extends the pause window.
