This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers\n// many common types of tokens that will not work with the Vault architecture. (See https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20\n// for examples of token features that are problematic for many protocols.)\n//\n// * Rebasing tokens (e.g., aDAI). The Vault keeps track of token balances in its internal accounting; any token whose\n//   balance changes asynchronously (i.e., outside a swap or liquidity operation), would get out-of-sync with this\n//   internal accounting. This category would also include \"airdrop\" tokens, whose balances can change unexpectedly.\n//\n// * Double entrypoint (e.g., old Synthetix tokens, now fixed). These could likewise bypass internal accounting by\n//   registering the token under one address, then accessing it through another. This is especially troublesome\n//   in v3, with the introduction of ERC4626 buffers.\n//\n// * Fee on transfer (e.g., PAXG). The Vault issues credits and debits according to given and calculated token amounts,\n//   and settlement assumes that the send/receive transfer functions transfer exactly the given number of tokens.\n//   If this is not the case, transactions will not settle. Unlike with the other types, which are fundamentally\n//   incompatible, it would be possible to design a Router to handle this - but we didn't try it. In any case, it's\n//   not supported in the current Routers.\n//\n// * Tokens with more than 18 decimals (e.g., YAM-V2). The Vault handles token scaling: i.e., handling I/O for\n//   amounts in native token decimals, but doing calculations with full 18-decimal precision. This requires reading\n//   and storing the decimals for each token. Since virtually all tokens are 18 or fewer decimals, and we have limited\n//   storage space, 18 was a reasonable maximum. Unlike the other types, this is enforceable by the Vault. Attempting\n//   to register such tokens will revert with `InvalidTokenDecimals`. Of course, we must also be able to read the token\n//   decimals, so the Vault only supports tokens that implement `IERC20Metadata.decimals`, and return a value less than\n//   or equal to 18.\n//\n//  * Token decimals are checked and stored only once, on registration. Valid tokens store their decimals as immutable\n//    variables or constants. Malicious tokens that don't respect this basic property would not work anywhere in DeFi.\n//\n// These types of tokens are supported but discouraged, as they don't tend to play well with AMMs generally.\n//\n// * Very low-decimal tokens (e.g., GUSD). The Vault has been extensively tested with 6-decimal tokens (e.g., USDC),\n//   but going much below that may lead to unanticipated effects due to precision loss, especially with smaller trade\n//   values.\n//\n// * Revert on zero value approval/transfer. The Vault has been tested against these, but peripheral contracts, such\n//   as hooks, might not have been designed with this in mind.\n//\n// * Other types from \"weird-erc20,\" such as upgradeable, pausable, or tokens with blocklists. We have seen cases\n//   where a token upgrade fails, \"bricking\" the token - and many operations on pools containing that token. Any\n//   sort of \"permissioned\" token that can make transfers fail can cause operations on pools containing them to\n//   revert. Even Recovery Mode cannot help then, as it does a proportional withdrawal of all tokens. If one of\n//   them is bricked, the whole operation will revert. Since v3 does not have \"internal balances\" like v2, there\n//   is no recourse.\n//\n//   Of course, many tokens in common use have some of these \"features\" (especially centralized stable coins), so\n//   we have to support them anyway. Working with common centralized tokens is a risk common to all of DeFi.\n\n/**\n * @notice Token types supported by the Vault.\n * @dev In general, pools may contain any combination of these tokens.\n *\n * STANDARD tokens (e.g., BAL, WETH) have no rate provider.\n * WITH_RATE tokens (e.g., wstETH) require a rate provider. These may be tokens like wstETH, which need to be wrapped\n * because the underlying stETH token is rebasing, and such tokens are unsupported by the Vault. They may also be\n * tokens like sEUR, which track an underlying asset, but are not yield-bearing. Finally, this encompasses\n * yield-bearing ERC4626 tokens, which can be used to facilitate swaps without requiring wrapping or unwrapping\n * in most cases. The `paysYieldFees` flag can be used to indicate whether a token is yield-bearing (e.g., waDAI),\n * not yield-bearing (e.g., sEUR), or yield-bearing but exempt from fees (e.g., in certain nested pools, where\n * yield fees are charged elsewhere).\n *\n * NB: STANDARD must always be the first enum element, so that newly initialized data structures default to Standard.\n */\nenum TokenType {\n    STANDARD,\n    WITH_RATE\n}\n\n/**\n * @notice Encapsulate the data required for the Vault to support a token of the given type.\n * @dev For STANDARD tokens, the rate provider address must be 0, and paysYieldFees must be false.

The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

The first is to support the many instances where we need to know that a contract is \"trusted\" (i.e.,\n * is safe and behaves in the required manner). For instance, some hooks depend critically on the identity of the\n * msg.sender, which must be passed down through the Router. Since Routers are permissionless, a malicious one could\n * spoof the sender and \"fool\" the hook. The hook must therefore \"trust\" the Router.\n *\n * It is also important for the front-end to know when a particular wrapped token should be used with buffers. Not all\n * \"ERC4626\" wrapped tokens are fully conforming, and buffer operations with non-conforming tokens may fail in various\n * unexpected ways. It is not enough to simply check whether a buffer exists (e.g., by calling `getBufferAsset`),\n * since best practice is for the pool creator to initialize buffers for all such tokens regardless. They are\n * permissionless, and could otherwise be initialized by anyone in unexpected ways. This registry could be used to\n * keep track of \"known good\" buffers, such that `isActiveBalancerContract(ContractType.ERC4626, <address>)` returns\n * true for fully-compliant tokens with properly initialized buffers.\n *\n * Current solutions involve passing in the address of the trusted Router on deployment: but what if it needs to\n * support multiple Routers? Or if the Router is deprecated and replaced? Instead, we can pass the registry address,\n * and query this contract to determine whether the Router is a \"trusted\" one.\n *\n * The second use case is for off-chain queries, or other protocols that need to easily determine, say, the \"latest\"\n * Weighted Pool Factory. This contract provides `isActiveBalancerContract(type, address)` for the first case, and\n * `getBalancerContract(type, name)` for the second. It is also possible to query all known information about an\n * address, using `getBalancerContractInfo(address)`, which returns a struct with the detailed state.\n *\n * Note that the `SingletonAuthentication` base contract provides `getVault`, so it is also possible to ask this\n * contract for the Vault address, so it doesn't need to be a type.\n */\ncontract BalancerContractRegistry is IBalancerContractRegistry, SingletonAuthentication {\n    // ContractId is the hash of contract name.

@dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by\n presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n ==== Security Considerations\n There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":6445,"linearizedBaseContracts":[6445],"name":"IERC20Permit","nameLocation":"2123:12:29","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"documentation":{"id":6413,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2142:850:29","text":" @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n ordering also apply here.\n Emits an {Approval} event.\n Requirements:\n -

@notice On-chain registry of standard Balancer contracts.\n @dev Maintain a registry of official Balancer Factories, Routers, Hooks, and valid ERC4626 tokens, for two main\n purposes. The first is to support the many instances where we need to know that a contract is \"trusted\" (i.e.,\n is safe and behaves in the required manner). For instance, some hooks depend critically on the identity of the\n msg.sender, which must be passed down through the Router. Since Routers are permissionless, a malicious one could\n spoof the sender and \"fool\" the hook. The hook must therefore \"trust\" the Router.\n It is also important for the front-end to know when a particular wrapped token should be used with buffers. Not all\n \"ERC4626\" wrapped tokens are fully conforming, and buffer operations with non-conforming tokens may fail in various\n unexpected ways. It is not enough to simply check whether a buffer exists (e.g., by calling `getBufferAsset`),\n since best practice is for the pool creator to initialize buffers for all such tokens regardless. They are\n permissionless, and could otherwise be initialized by anyone in unexpected ways. This registry could be used to\n keep track of \"known good\" buffers, such that `isActiveBalancerContract(ContractType.ERC4626, <address>)` returns\n true for fully-compliant tokens with properly initialized buffers.\n Current solutions involve passing in the address of the trusted Router on deployment: but what if it needs to\n support multiple Routers? Or if the Router is deprecated and replaced? Instead, we can pass the registry address,\n and query this contract to determine whether the Router is a \"trusted\" one.\n The second use case is for off-chain queries, or other protocols that need to easily determine, say, the \"latest\"\n Weighted Pool Factory. This contract provides `isActiveBalancerContract(type, address)` for the first case, and\n `getBalancerContract(type, name)` for the second. It is also possible to query all known information about an\n address, using `getBalancerContractInfo(address)`, which returns a struct with the detailed state.\n Note that the `SingletonAuthentication` base contract provides `getVault`, so it is also possible to ask this\n contract for the Vault address, so it doesn't need to be a

To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events.

Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all. ==== Security Considerations There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

a registry of official Balancer Factories, Routers, Hooks, and valid ERC4626 tokens, for two main purposes. The first is to support the many instances where we need to know that a contract is \\\"trusted\\\" (i.e., is safe and behaves in the required manner). For instance, some hooks depend critically on the identity of the msg.sender, which must be passed down through the Router. Since Routers are permissionless, a malicious one could spoof the sender and \\\"fool\\\" the hook. The hook must therefore \\\"trust\\\" the Router. It is also important for the front-end to know when a particular wrapped token should be used with buffers. Not all \\\"ERC4626\\\" wrapped tokens are fully conforming, and buffer operations with non-conforming tokens may fail in various unexpected ways. It is not enough to simply check whether a buffer exists (e.g., by calling `getBufferAsset`), since best practice is for the pool creator to initialize buffers for all such tokens regardless. They are permissionless, and could otherwise be initialized by anyone in unexpected ways. This registry could be used to keep track of \\\"known good\\\" buffers, such that `isActiveBalancerContract(ContractType.ERC4626, <address>)` returns true for fully-compliant tokens with properly initialized buffers. Current solutions involve passing in the address of the trusted Router on deployment: but what if it needs to support multiple Routers? Or if the Router is deprecated and replaced? Instead, we can pass the registry address, and query this contract to determine whether the Router is a \\\"trusted\\\" one. The second use case is for off-chain queries, or other protocols that need to easily determine, say, the \\\"latest\\\" Weighted Pool Factory. This contract provides `isActiveBalancerContract(type, address)` for the first case, and `getBalancerContract(type, name)` for the second. It is also possible to query all known information about an address, using `getBalancerContractInfo(address)`, which returns a struct with the detailed state. Note that the `SingletonAuthentication` base contract provides `getVault`, so it is also possible to ask this contract for the Vault address, so it doesn't need to be a type.\",\"errors\":{\"ContractAddressAlreadyRegistered(uint8,address)\":[{\"details\":\"Both names and addresses must be unique in the primary registration mapping.
