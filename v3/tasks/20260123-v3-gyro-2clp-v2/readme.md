# 2026-01-23 - Gyro 2-CLP V2

Second deployment of the `Gyro2CLPFactory` for Balancer V3.
Pools from this factory use Gyroscope's 2-CLP math, suitable for fungible concentrated liquidity applications.

This version allows pools to be deployed with pool creators, and greatly extends the pause window.
