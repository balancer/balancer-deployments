> The stable pool was superseded by this [updated version](../../tasks/20250324-v3-stable-pool-v2/).

The original pool is still safe to use; V2 just includes new functionality.

Deployment of the `StablePoolFactory` for Balancer V3.
Pools from this factory use stable math, inspired by Curve stable pools, which is best suited for correlated assets.
