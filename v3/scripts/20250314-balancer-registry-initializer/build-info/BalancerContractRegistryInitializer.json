This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers\n// many common types of tokens that will not work with the Vault architecture. (See https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20\n// for examples of token features that are problematic for many protocols.)\n//\n// * Rebasing tokens (e.g., aDAI). The Vault keeps track of token balances in its internal accounting; any token whose\n//   balance changes asynchronously (i.e., outside a swap or liquidity operation), would get out-of-sync with this\n//   internal accounting. This category would also include \"airdrop\" tokens, whose balances can change unexpectedly.\n//\n// * Double entrypoint (e.g., old Synthetix tokens, now fixed). These could likewise bypass internal accounting by\n//   registering the token under one address, then accessing it through another. This is especially troublesome\n//   in v3, with the introduction of ERC4626 buffers.\n//\n// * Fee on transfer (e.g., PAXG). The Vault issues credits and debits according to given and calculated token amounts,\n//   and settlement assumes that the send/receive transfer functions transfer exactly the given number of tokens.\n//   If this is not the case, transactions will not settle. Unlike with the other types, which are fundamentally\n//   incompatible, it would be possible to design a Router to handle this - but we didn't try it. In any case, it's\n//   not supported in the current Routers.\n//\n// * Tokens with more than 18 decimals (e.g., YAM-V2). The Vault handles token scaling: i.e., handling I/O for\n//   amounts in native token decimals, but doing calculations with full 18-decimal precision. This requires reading\n//   and storing the decimals for each token. Since virtually all tokens are 18 or fewer decimals, and we have limited\n//   storage space, 18 was a reasonable maximum. Unlike the other types, this is enforceable by the Vault. Attempting\n//   to register such tokens will revert with `InvalidTokenDecimals`. Of course, we must also be able to read the token\n//   decimals, so the Vault only supports tokens that implement `IERC20Metadata.decimals`, and return a value less than\n//   or equal to 18.\n//\n//  * Token decimals are checked and stored only once, on registration. Valid tokens store their decimals as immutable\n//    variables or constants. Malicious tokens that don't respect this basic property would not work anywhere in DeFi.\n//\n// These types of tokens are supported but discouraged, as they don't tend to play well with AMMs generally.\n//\n// * Very low-decimal tokens (e.g., GUSD). The Vault has been extensively tested with 6-decimal tokens (e.g., USDC),\n//   but going much below that may lead to unanticipated effects due to precision loss, especially with smaller trade\n//   values.\n//\n// * Revert on zero value approval/transfer. The Vault has been tested against these, but peripheral contracts, such\n//   as hooks, might not have been designed with this in mind.\n//\n// * Other types from \"weird-erc20,\" such as upgradeable, pausable, or tokens with blocklists. We have seen cases\n//   where a token upgrade fails, \"bricking\" the token - and many operations on pools containing that token. Any\n//   sort of \"permissioned\" token that can make transfers fail can cause operations on pools containing them to\n//   revert. Even Recovery Mode cannot help then, as it does a proportional withdrawal of all tokens. If one of\n//   them is bricked, the whole operation will revert. Since v3 does not have \"internal balances\" like v2, there\n//   is no recourse.\n//\n//   Of course, many tokens in common use have some of these \"features\" (especially centralized stable coins), so\n//   we have to support them anyway. Working with common centralized tokens is a risk common to all of DeFi.\n\n/**\n * @notice Token types supported by the Vault.\n * @dev In general, pools may contain any combination of these tokens.\n *\n * STANDARD tokens (e.g., BAL, WETH) have no rate provider.\n * WITH_RATE tokens (e.g., wstETH) require a rate provider. These may be tokens like wstETH, which need to be wrapped\n * because the underlying stETH token is rebasing, and such tokens are unsupported by the Vault. They may also be\n * tokens like sEUR, which track an underlying asset, but are not yield-bearing. Finally, this encompasses\n * yield-bearing ERC4626 tokens, which can be used to facilitate swaps without requiring wrapping or unwrapping\n * in most cases. The `paysYieldFees` flag can be used to indicate whether a token is yield-bearing (e.g., waDAI),\n * not yield-bearing (e.g., sEUR), or yield-bearing but exempt from fees (e.g., in certain nested pools, where\n * yield fees are charged elsewhere).\n *\n * NB: STANDARD must always be the first enum element, so that newly initialized data structures default to Standard.\n */\nenum TokenType {\n    STANDARD,\n    WITH_RATE\n}\n\n/**\n * @notice Encapsulate the data required for the Vault to support a token of the given type.\n * @dev For STANDARD tokens, the rate provider address must be 0, and paysYieldFees must be false.

Protocol fees can always be overwritten by governance, but\n * pool creator fees are controlled by the registered poolCreator (see `PoolRoleAccounts`).\n *\n * The Vault stores a single aggregate percentage for swap and yield fees; only this `ProtocolFeeController` knows\n * the component fee percentages, and how to compute the aggregate from the components. This is done for performance\n * reasons, to minimize gas on the critical path, as this way the Vault simply applies a single \"cut\", and stores the\n * fee amounts separately from the pool balances.\n *\n * The pool creator fees are \"net\" protocol fees, meaning the protocol fee is taken first, and the pool creator fee\n * percentage is applied to the remainder. Essentially, the protocol is paid first, then the remainder is divided\n * between the pool creator and the LPs.\n *\n * There is a permissionless function (`collectAggregateFees`) that transfers these tokens from the Vault to this\n * contract, and distributes them between the protocol and pool creator, after which they can be withdrawn at any\n * time by governance and the pool creator, respectively.\n *\n * Protocol fees can be zero in some cases (e.g., the token is registered as exempt), and pool creator fees are zero\n * if there is no creator role address defined. Protocol fees are capped at a maximum percentage (50%); pool creator\n * fees are computed \"net\" protocol fees, so they can be any value from 0 to 100%. Any combination is possible.\n * A protocol-fee-exempt pool with a 100% pool creator fee would send all fees to the creator. If there is no pool\n * creator, a pool with a 50% protocol fee would divide the fees evenly between the protocol and LPs.\n *\n * This contract is deployed with the Vault, but can be changed by governance.\n */\ncontract ProtocolFeeController is\n    IProtocolFeeController,\n    SingletonAuthentication,\n    ReentrancyGuardTransient,\n    VaultGuard\n{\n    using FixedPoint for uint256;\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n    using SafeCast for *;\n\n    enum ProtocolFeeType {\n        SWAP,\n        YIELD\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Fee configuration stored in the swap and yield fee mappings.\n     * @dev Instead of storing only the fee in the mapping, also store a flag to indicate whether the fee has been\n     * set by governance through a permissioned call.

The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

@notice Helper contract to manage protocol and creator fees outside the Vault.\n @dev This contract stores global default protocol swap and yield fees, and also tracks the values of those fees\n for each pool (the `PoolFeeConfig` described below). Protocol fees can always be overwritten by governance, but\n pool creator fees are controlled by the registered poolCreator (see `PoolRoleAccounts`).\n The Vault stores a single aggregate percentage for swap and yield fees; only this `ProtocolFeeController` knows\n the component fee percentages, and how to compute the aggregate from the components. This is done for performance\n reasons, to minimize gas on the critical path, as this way the Vault simply applies a single \"cut\", and stores the\n fee amounts separately from the pool balances.\n The pool creator fees are \"net\" protocol fees, meaning the protocol fee is taken first, and the pool creator fee\n percentage is applied to the remainder. Essentially, the protocol is paid first, then the remainder is divided\n between the pool creator and the LPs.\n There is a permissionless function (`collectAggregateFees`) that transfers these tokens from the Vault to this\n contract, and distributes them between the protocol and pool creator, after which they can be withdrawn at any\n time by governance and the pool creator, respectively.\n Protocol fees can be zero in some cases (e.g., the token is registered as exempt), and pool creator fees are zero\n if there is no creator role address defined. Protocol fees are capped at a maximum percentage (50%); pool creator\n fees are computed \"net\" protocol fees, so they can be any value from 0 to 100%. Any combination is possible.\n A protocol-fee-exempt pool with a 100% pool creator fee would send all fees to the creator.

@dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n ==== Security Considerations\n There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning.

contract stores global default protocol swap and yield fees, and also tracks the values of those fees for each pool (the `PoolFeeConfig` described below). Protocol fees can always be overwritten by governance, but pool creator fees are controlled by the registered poolCreator (see `PoolRoleAccounts`). The Vault stores a single aggregate percentage for swap and yield fees; only this `ProtocolFeeController` knows the component fee percentages, and how to compute the aggregate from the components. This is done for performance reasons, to minimize gas on the critical path, as this way the Vault simply applies a single \\\"cut\\\", and stores the fee amounts separately from the pool balances. The pool creator fees are \\\"net\\\" protocol fees, meaning the protocol fee is taken first, and the pool creator fee percentage is applied to the remainder. Essentially, the protocol is paid first, then the remainder is divided between the pool creator and the LPs. There is a permissionless function (`collectAggregateFees`) that transfers these tokens from the Vault to this contract, and distributes them between the protocol and pool creator, after which they can be withdrawn at any time by governance and the pool creator, respectively. Protocol fees can be zero in some cases (e.g., the token is registered as exempt), and pool creator fees are zero if there is no creator role address defined. Protocol fees are capped at a maximum percentage (50%); pool creator fees are computed \\\"net\\\" protocol fees, so they can be any value from 0 to 100%. Any combination is possible. A protocol-fee-exempt pool with a 100% pool creator fee would send all fees to the creator. If there is no pool creator, a pool with a 50% protocol fee would divide the fees evenly between the protocol and LPs.

Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all. ==== Security Considerations There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

particular, when protocol fees are initially turned off). After deployment, call `migratePools` as many times as necessary. The list must be generated externally, as pools are not iterable on-chain. The batch interface allows an unlimited number of pools to be migrated; it's possible there might be too many to migrate in a single call. The first time `migratePools` is called, the contract will first copy the global (pool-independent data). This could be done in a separate stage, but we're trying to keep the contract simple, vs. duplicating the staging coordinator system of v2 just yet. When all pools have been migrated, call `finalizeMigration` to disable further migration, update the address in the Vault, and renounce all permissions. While `migratePools` is permissionless, this call must be permissioned to prevent premature termination in case multiple transactions are required to migrate all the pools.
