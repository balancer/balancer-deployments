# 2025-04-11 - V3 Balancer Contract Registry Initializer (V2)

Second deployment of the `BalancerContractRegistryInitializer`, responsible for populating the registry with routers and pool factories (and initial aliases).

This updates the StablePool and StableSurgePool factories to V2, and adds the Gyro 2CLP and ECLP pools.
